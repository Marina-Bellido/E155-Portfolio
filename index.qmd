I am a senior engineering major at Harvey Mudd College interested in electrical and computer engineering/digital design. I'm currently doing research as a Clay-Wolkin Fellow at Harvey Mudd's VLSI lab developing a comprehensive open-source functional verification suite for RISC-V processors. I have experience with SystemVerilog and RISC-V assembly and would love to continue to grow my computer engineering skills. I'm always excited to learn new things and would be happy to connect with you!
