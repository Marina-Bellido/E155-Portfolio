I’m currently doing research as a Clay-Wolkin Fellow at Harvey Mudd’s VLSI lab developing a comprehensive open-source functional verification suite for RISC-V processors. I have experience with SystemVerilog and RISC-V assembly and would love to continue to grow my computer engineering skills. I’m always excited to learn new things and would be happy to connect with you!"

I solved that by starting questa directly from Lattice Radiant, which did allow me to add the specific library.\nOnce I had Questa working, I created two testbenches to verify that my Verilog was working correctly for both modules. These testbenches load a series of testvectors that simulate all of the possible combinations of switches and checks that LEDs 0 and 1 along with the 7-segment display have the appropriate outputs.\nThe resulting waveforms can be found below:\n\n\n\nResulting waveform is pictured below for the top module that included both the LEDs and the 7-segment display\n\n\n\n\n\nResulting waveform is pictured below for the 7-segment display module\n\n\nWhen run, the testbenches finished with the following message, indicating a successful run.\n16 tests completed with 0 errors.\nAll testbenches and testvector files can be found here."

The board has several features that are convenient for developing embedded systems such as:\n\nPins which can be directly routed from the MCU to the FPGA via the board\nExtension headers for the mikroBUS and 6-pin PMOD standard\nUser configurable LEDs, pushbuttons, and slider switches.\nHeader to route pins via a ribbon cable to a separate breadboard adapter PCB which can be inserted into a solderless breadboard.\n\nAfter soldering all of the components to my board, I was having weird issues with the LEDS not turning on. After lots of troubleshooting, I eventually traced it down to a bad solder joint in the neighbouring resistors and after reflowing it the board was working correctly.\nThe assembled board can be seen here:"
