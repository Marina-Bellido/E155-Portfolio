After lots of troubleshooting, I eventually traced it down to a bad solder joint in the neighbouring resistors and after reflowing it the board was working correctly.\nThe assembled board can be seen here:"

Driving an I/O pin low turns on the corresponding LED segment.\n\nResistor Calculation\nTo determine the appropriate resistor value, I used the forward voltage and current ratings from the 7-segment display datasheet. In the datasheet, the voltage drop is typically 2.1 V, so with a 3.3 V supply voltage the resistor will have 1.2 V going through it. I wanted to keep the current within the labs constraints 5-20mA to ensure low power draw so the LEDs were bright enough to see. I choose a 150ohms resistor which ended up giving me a current of 8mA (within range).\nDatasheet: HDSP-511x\n\n\nCounter Frequency Value\nI used the starter code given on the website which had a clk that had a frequency of 2.4MHz and the opjective was to blink LED[2] at a frequency of 2.4Hz. To achieve that I divided the given frequency by the desired and then divided again by 2 since the clk has two edges. That resulted in 5M cycles every toggle.\n\n\n\nCorrect frequency output for led[2] = 2.4 Hz"

On top of that, I added an adder for the LEDs addition. I had my two DIP switches as inputs and used the counter producing that slower clock to alternate which set of switches is sent to the 7-segment decoder and ensures that the appropriate anode is activated."

Also have a forward voltage from the PMP transistor of 0.6. This would give us a voltage drop of 2.6 and any resistor above 2.6kohms would satisfy our constraints. I chose 3kohms.\nThe LEDs in the 7-segment display have a voltage drop of 1.8 V (datasheet), and the PMP has a Vcesat of 0.25. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint of less than 8mA, our resistor value must be above 156.25ohms. I choose a current-limiting resistor of 200 ohms.
